# QuantumPulse - space age computing
An OS that is written for 64 bit risc-v and follows the worse is better approach:
	- **Simplicity**
	  The design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface. Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design.
	- **Correctness**
	  The design should be correct in all observable aspects. It is slightly better to be simple than correct.
	- **Consistency**
	  The design must not be overly inconsistent. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to introduce either complexity or inconsistency in the implementation.
	- **Completeness**
	  The design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases should be covered. Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality. In fact, completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained; especially worthless is consistency of interface.
Which allows for cutting-edge speed if you desire to do one of the 0 things that are currently supported.
# Todo:
	- Minimum viable product:
		- Display an image via HDMI
		- Accept user input via keyboard
		- Add wireless connectivity via ethernet or wifi (whichever is easier)
		- Add support for manipulating the built-in storage
		- Build a basic UI for one of the following:
			- Youtube
			- Teams
			- Microsoft office (word, excel, powepoint ETC)
			- Editing code
			- Phind/custom AI assistant
			- Discord
			- Github
			- Gitlab
	- Nice extras:
		- Implement GPU accelaration
		- Nice animations
		- Wireless connectivity over wifi (if not already implemented)
		- Build the rest of the basic UI's
	- Required for laptops:
		- Support however laptops display images and accept keyboard input
	- Required for tablets:
		- Support however tablets display images and accept touch input
		- Perhaps add bluetooth functionality
		- Perhaps add camera and mic functionality
